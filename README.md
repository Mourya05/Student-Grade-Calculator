# Student-Grade-Calculator
The `Student_Grade_Calculator` program is a Java application designed to calculate and display a student's total marks, average percentage, and grade based on marks entered for multiple subjects. The program uses the `Scanner` class to gather input from the user, starting with the number of subjects and their respective marks. It calculates the total and average marks by iterating through the input array, then assigns a grade based on predefined percentage ranges (e.g., 'S' for 91–100%, 'A' for 81–90%, and so on). The program concludes by printing the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade, providing a straightforward way to evaluate academic performance.
